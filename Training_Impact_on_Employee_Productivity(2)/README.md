# Training Impact on Employee Productivity

## Objective
To analyze whether employee training hours have a measurable impact on employee productivity using data-driven analysis.

## Project Background
This project was completed as part of my MBA in Data Science. The analysis evaluates the relationship between training hours and employee productivity to support evidence-based HR and operational decision-making.

## Dataset
- Employee training and productivity-related data
- Data used for academic analysis / simulated where required

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation and comparative analysis between training hours and productivity metrics

## Key Findings
- No significant relationship observed between training hours and employee productivity
- Increased training duration alone did not lead to consistent productivity improvements
- Results indicate that productivity may depend on multiple factors beyond training hours

## Business Interpretation
The findings suggest that:
- Training quality and relevance may matter more than total training hours
- Productivity improvements may require a combination of training, role alignment, and experience
- Data-driven evaluation is essential before increasing training investments

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates objective analysis, critical thinking, and the ability to derive meaningful business insights even when results challenge common assumptions.

## Notes
This project is shared for portfolio and learning purposes. Company-specific or sensitive information has been excluded.
